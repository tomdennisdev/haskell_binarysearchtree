This project implements a Binary Search Tree in Haskell, supporting key operations such as insertion, lookup, and deletion. The tree is structured using recursive data types, ensuring efficient organisation and retrieval of key-value pairs. The project includes unit tests using HUnit and property-based tests with QuickCheck.
